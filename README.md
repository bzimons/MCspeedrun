# mcspeedrun

This is a Bar Chart Race for the Minecraft speedrun 1.16+ RSG sub20. I got this idea from the History of Minecraft speedrun video made by Abacaba and I wanted to see what I could do similarly in Python.

 All the data was collected from the official speedrun website on July 8 of 2021, may not be accurate. The bar_chart_race library was original made by dexplo but I had to modify some parts of the original code in order to get what I needed.

The reason that I've decided to do only sub20 board is because there's currently 2565 verifyed runs, it would take a long time to read everyplayer.
